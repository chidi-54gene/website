            <ol>
              <li>
                Some of the rights you have for providing us your information
                are complex, and not all of the details have been included in
                our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws
                and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full
                explanation of these rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your principal rights under data protection laws for providing
                your data to 54Gene are:
                <ul>
                  <li>the right to access;</li>
                  <li>the right to rectification;</li>
                  <li>the right to erasure;</li>
                  <li>the right to restrict processing;</li>

                  <li>the right to data portability;</li>
                  <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</li>
                  <li>the right to withdraw consent.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we
                process your personal data and, where we do, access to the
                personal data, together with certain additional information.
                That additional information includes details of the purposes of
                the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and
                the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and
                freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a
                copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free
                of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable
                fee. You can access your personal data when logged into our
                website by opening the settings on your account information.
              </li>
              <li>
                You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about
                you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the
                processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
                completed.
              </li>
              <li>
                In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
                personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include
                where: the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to
                the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
                processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you
                object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data
                protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes;
                and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However,
                there are exclusions of this right to erasure where processing
                is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression
                and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for
                the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
              </li>
              <li>
                In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
                processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you
                contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is
                unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal
                data for the purposes of our processing, but you require
                personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of
                legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the
                verification of that objection. Where processing has been
                restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal
                data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your
                consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
                claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
                legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
              </li>
              <li>
                You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
                data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only
                to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that
                the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task
                carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any
                official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
                legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you
                make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal
                information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
                grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights
                and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment,
                exercise or defense of legal claims.
              </li>
              <li>
                You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
                data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for
                direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we
                will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
                personal data is:
                <ul>
                  <li>consent; or</li>
                  <li>
                    that the processing is necessary for the performance of a
                    contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at
                    your request prior to entering into a contract,
                  </li>
                </ul>

                and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have
                the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured,
                commonly used and machine- readable format. However, this right
                does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and
                freedoms of others.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you consider that our processing of your personal information
                infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge
                a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
                protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your
                habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the
                alleged infringement. In Nigeria, you may do so to do the
                National Information Technology Development Agency.
              </li>
              <li>
                To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
                personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw
                that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the
                lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal
                data by written notice to us in addition to the other methods
                specified in this Section.
