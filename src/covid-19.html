            <p>
              As a health technology company advancing the state of healthcare
              for the benefit of Africans and the global population, the
              COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria was for us, a call to action. With
              our existing technical capabilities and infrastructure, we made
              the decision to create a response that was geared at increasing
              testing capacity in Nigeria.

            <p>
              At the beginning of the pandemic, Nigeria’s COVID-19 testing
              capacity was around 200 tests a day. Speed was needed and we
              quickly raised a total of $500,000 to increase the testing
              capacity in public laboratories by at least 1,000 additional tests
              per day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the Nigeria COVID-19 fund, we delivered vital molecular
              testing instruments to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control
              (NCDC) and other public laboratories. These included items such as
              multiple high throughput and low throughput PCR machines,
              automated RNA extractors, magnetic racks, heating blocks,
              microcentrifuges, vortexes, laptops, and other items.

            <p>
              The pandemic exposed the lack of existing molecular laboratories
              in Nigeria. Because there was a need to increase testing quickly
              we developed a COVID-19 mobile lab solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our COVID-19 mobile lab removed the restriction imposed by
              permanent buildings and allowed us to quickly offer our services
              to multiple states due to the ease of transport and the mobile
              capability it provided.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the 27th of April, we became one of the first private
              laboratories to receive approval to join the network of accredited
              testing centres in the country.
            </p>

            <p>
              Within a period of four months, we had established five fully
              functional mobile laboratories in four states: Ogun (Ota and
              Abeokuta), Kano, Abuja and Ekiti, while also offering testing
              services in our physical laboratory in Lagos to support the
              states’ efforts to increase testing capacity.

              We provided COVID-19 testing services to people who were
              previously unable to return to Nigeria due to the pandemic and the
              resulting close of borders imposed by the governments of most
              countries to curb the spread of the virus. Our testing services
              enabled the federal government to drive key decisions on isolation
              where necessary. So far, we have tested more than 4,000 passengers
              who have returned to Nigeria from over 14 different countries
              including Ghana, Egypt, Kenya, UAE, South Africa, Senegal, Israel,
              London, Sudan, Germany, Pakistan, Turkey and UK. Our Covid-19
              testing services are currently still ongoing for those returning
              to their countries or coming back into Nigeria.

            <h2>Addressing the Dearth in Molecular Scientists</h2>
            <p>
              As we began to set up multiple laboratories to augment testing for
              COVID-19 in the country, it became apparent that there was a void
              in the skill set required to work in these labs. This meant that
              there was a need to build capacity and knowledge transfer needed
              to take place. We have so far trained over 40 molecular scientists
              on PCR techniques and empowered them with the requisite skills
              required for COVID-19 testing.

            <h2 class="mt-0">Molecular Training Academy</h2>

            <p>
              The lack of infrastructure and adequate knowledge base makes local
              universities within the country unable to train the molecular
              scientists that come out of these institutes to international
              standards. This conceived our molecular training academy which was
              set up to exemplify what a molecular scientist should typically
              know both theoretically and practically.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our first set of 10 trainees began their 4-week training on the
              25th of June and will be graduating from the academy on the 18th
              of July. During the 4 weeks of training, the trainees have been
              taken through comprehensive modules of molecular science taught
              physically by two of our already trained in-house molecular
              scientists and virtually by our Senior Director, Molecular
              Genetics and Biobank Operations, Dr. Jumi Popoola.

                        detection as it is highly sensitive and highly specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. It is
                        also currently the only approved method of detection for COVID-19.
