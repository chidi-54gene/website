                    <li>
                      We will impact the quality of healthcare in Africa by increasing access to genomic data from
                      African
                      populations to promote inclusive research and development, which will lead to
                      <ul class="faq-ul-inner">
                        <li>optimized treatment and diagnostic outcomes for the African population, and</li>
                        <li>power drug discoveries that will treat Africans, but also treat all people</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Presently, most genomic data used for development research is from Europe, United Kingdom and
                      North
                      American
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      We want to address the fact that less than 3% of genomic data available is African and the need to
                      include underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities research.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Increasing access to genomic data from African populations can:
                      <ul>
                        <li>improve the responsiveness of products to the health of African people and
