            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Please note that by signing up to order a test, you accept our
              terms and conditions as contained in this Important Notice and as
              set out in our Terms of Use.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Turn-Around-Time (TAT) for test results is 20 - 48 hours from
              receipt of your samples at our laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our laboratories are not located at our sample collection centers
              and the estimated time for the receipt of samples at our
              laboratories is within 24 hours from sample collection at our
              collection centers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that you are responsible for scheduling your tests in
              good time to receive your results within the stipulated TAT.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are scheduling a test for travel purposes, we recommend
              that you take into consideration the following time periods in
              order to receive your results ahead of your scheduled flight:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>20 hours</strong> from sample collection to receipt at
                the laboratory
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>48 hours</strong> TAT from receipt of samples at the
                laboratory to result availability
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              For customers who need to produce a negative test result dated
              within 72 hours of departure of a scheduled flight, sample
              collection and tests should be booked:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No sooner than <strong>92 hours</strong> prior to departure of
                scheduled flight; and
              </li>
              <li>
                No later than <strong>60 hours</strong> prior to departure of
                scheduled flight
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This allows customers a 32 hours window in which to complete their
              testing to ensure we do not produce a result too soon or too late.
            </p>
            <p>
              54gene shall not withhold the release of results for clients who
              have had a test carried out beyond these time frames simply
              because the client wishes for the results to indicate the 72 hours
              window. 54gene shall not be held liable for any inconvenience or
              loss suffered due to customers failure to adopt these time
              considerations before ordering a test.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the flight is canceled and rescheduled for a different time,
              customers should refer to their Airline for its policy on whether
              the results will be accepted or if they would need to order a new
              test accordingly. 54gene shall not be held liable for any
              inconvenience or loss suffered for flight cancellations by
              customer’s Airline including customer having to order a new test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that you are solely responsible for booking and
              scheduling your tests and the tests of your dependents in line
              with the prescribed time periods above.
