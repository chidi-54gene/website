            <h2 class="numbered">Policy Brief and Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of this policy is to establish controls to ensure
              compliance with all applicable anti-bribery and corruption
              regulations, and to ensure that the Company’s business is
              conducted in a socially and ethically responsible manner.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our reputation and success as a company is built upon a foundation
              of integrity – a commitment to act within the highest ethical
              standards and to conduct our business honestly and legally hence,
              any taint of bribery and corruption can significantly tarnish our
              Company’s reputation and image. Our Code of Conduct and this
              policy reflect this commitment.
            </p>

            <h2 class="numbered">Policy</h2>

            <p>
              It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and
              ethical manner.
            </p>

            <p>
              We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We
              are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity
              in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate
              and implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter
              bribery.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and
              corruption in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. We remain
              bound by the laws in all the areas where we are registered and do
              business in with respect to our conduct both at home and abroad.
            </p>

            <h2 class="numbered">Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This policy applies to all employees (whether temporary,
              fixed-term, or permanent), consultants, contractors, research and
              site personnel, trainees, seconded staff, home workers, casual
              workers, agency staff, volunteers, interns, agents, sponsors, or
              any other person or persons associated with us (including third
              parties), or any of our subsidiaries or their employees, no matter
              where they are located (within or outside of Nigeria). This policy
              also applies to Officers, Trustees, Board, and/or Committee
              members at any level.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the context of this policy, third-party refers to any
              individual or organization our Company meets and works with. It
              refers to actual and potential clients, customers, suppliers,
              distributors, business contacts, agents, advisers, and government
              and public bodies – this includes their advisors, representatives
              and officials, politicians, and public parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any arrangements our Company makes with a third party is subject
              to clear contractual terms, including specific provisions that
              require the third party to comply with minimum standards and
              procedures relating to anti-bribery and corruption.
            </p>
            <p>This policy covers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bribes</li>
              <li>Gifts and hospitality</li>
              <li>Facilitation payments</li>
              <li>Political contributions</li>
              <li>Charitable contributions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bribes</h3>
            <p>
              Bribery refers to the act of offering, giving, promising, asking,
              agreeing, receiving, accepting, or soliciting something of value
              or of an advantage so as to induce or influence an action or
              decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A bribe refers to any inducement, reward, or object/item of value
              offered to another individual in order to gain commercial,
              contractual, regulatory, or personal advantage. Bribes are not
              limited to cash, but can take many forms ranging from lavish
              entertainment to in-kind services to offers of employment. Bribery
              is not limited to the act of offering a bribe. If an individual is
              on the receiving end of a bribe and they accept it (passive), they
              are also breaking the law.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bribery is illegal. Employees must not engage in any form of
              bribery, whether it be directly, passively (as described above),
              or through a third party (such as an agent or distributor). You
              must not bribe an official anywhere in the world. Health Care
              Professionals (HCPs) are considered officials and the provisions
              of this policy applies to our interactions with them. You must not
              accept bribes in any degree and if you are uncertain about whether
              something is a bribe or a gift or act of hospitality, you must
              seek further advice from the Company’s compliance officer.
            </p>
            <h3>Gifts and hospitality</h3>
            <p>
              The Company accepts normal and appropriate gestures of hospitality
              and goodwill (whether given to/received from third parties) so
              long as the giving or receiving of gifts meets the following
              requirements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It is not made with the intention of influencing the party to
                whom it is being given, to obtain or reward the retention of a
                business or a business advantage, or as an explicit or implicit
                exchange for favors or benefits
              </li>
              <li>
                It is not made with the suggestion that a return favor is
                expected.
              </li>
              <li>It is in compliance with local law</li>
              <li>
                It is given in the name of the Company, not in an individual’s
                name
              </li>
              <li>
                It does not include cash or a cash equivalent (e.g. a voucher or
                gift certificate).
              </li>
              <li>
                It is appropriate for the circumstances (e.g. giving small gifts
                around religious holidays, or as a small thank you to a company
                for helping with a large project upon completion and must be
                pre-approved by the Compliance Officer).
              </li>
              <li>
                It is of an appropriate type and value and given at an
                appropriate time, taking into account the reason for the gift.
              </li>
              <li>It is given/received openly, not secretly.</li>
              <li>
                It is not selectively given to a key, influential person,
                clearly with the intention of directly influencing them.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is not above a certain excessive value, as pre-determined by
                the Company’s Compliance Officer (usually in excess of $100). In
                line with the other requirements under 3.2 on Gifts and
                Hospitality, gifts should be of nominal value and in no case
                greater than $50, otherwise will require pre-clearance with the
                Compliance Officer.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is not offered to, or accepted from, a government official or
                representative or politician or political party, without the
                prior approval of the Company’s Compliance Officer.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Where it is inappropriate to decline the offer of a gift (i.e.
              when meeting with an individual of a certain religion/culture who
              may take offence), the gift may be accepted but must be declared
              and disclosed to the Compliance Officer immediately and as soon as
              possible no later than 24 hours of receipt.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company recognizes that the practice of giving and receiving
              business gifts varies between countries, regions, cultures, and
              religions, so definitions of what is acceptable and not acceptable
              will inevitably differ for each. As good practice, gifts given and
              received should always be disclosed to the Compliance Officer.
              Gifts from suppliers should always be disclosed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intention behind a gift being given/received should always be
              considered. If there is any uncertainty, the advice of the
              Compliance Officer should be sought.
            </p>

            <h3>Facilitation Payments and Kickbacks</h3>
            <p>
              The Company does not accept and will not make any form of
              facilitation payments of any nature. We recognize that
              facilitation payments are a form of bribery that involves
              expediting or facilitating the performance of a public official
              for a routine governmental action. We recognize that they tend to
              be made by low level officials with the intention of securing or
              speeding up the performance of a certain duty or action.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company does not allow kickbacks to be made or accepted. We
              recognize that kickbacks are typically made in exchange for a
              business favor or advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company recognises that, despite our strict policy on
              facilitation payments and kickbacks, employees may face a
              situation where avoiding a facilitation payment or kickback may
              put their/their family’s personal security at risk. Under these
              circumstances, the following steps must be taken:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep any amount to the minimum.</li>
              <li>
                Ask for a receipt, detailing the amount and reason for the
                payment.
              </li>
              <li>Create a record concerning the payment.</li>
              <li>
                Report this incident to your line manager and Compliance Officer
                immediately and as soon as possible no later than 24 hours after
                the incident has occurred.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Political Contributions</h3>
            <p>
              We do not make donations, whether in cash or kind, in support of
              any political parties or candidates, as this can be perceived as
              an attempt to gain an improper business advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              We understand that some employees or affiliates of 54gene may have
              political affiliations and wish to make personal contributions.
              Employees do so on their sole discretion and not on behalf of
              54gene and must disclose any political contributions to the
              Compliance Officer to assess whether any conflicts of interest
              would arise and prevent same.
            </p>

            <h3>Charitable contributions</h3>
            <p>
              Charitable support and donations are acceptable (and indeed are
              encouraged), whether of in- kind services, knowledge, time, or
              direct financial contributions. However, employees must be careful
              to ensure that charitable contributions are not used as a scheme
              to conceal bribery. We only make charitable donations that are
              legal and ethical under local laws and practices. No donation must
              be offered or made without the prior approval of the Compliance
              Officer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Requests for charitable contributions/donations shall follow our
              third party onboarding and due diligence procedures. Contributions
              to charity organizations affiliated with any public official shall
              be reviewed thoroughly to ascertain that there are no red flags
              for our contributions; and can only be made upon express approval
              from the Compliance Officer. All due diligence activities relating
              to donations shall be documented.
            </p>
            <p>All charitable contributions should be publicly disclosed.</p>

            <h2 class="numbered">Your Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              You must ensure that you read, understand, and comply with the
              information contained within this policy, and with any training or
              other anti-bribery and corruption information you are given.
            </p>
            <p>
              All employees and those under our control are equally responsible
              for the prevention, detection, and reporting of bribery and other
              forms of corruption.
            </p>
            You are required to avoid any activities that could lead to, or
            imply, a breach of this anti-bribery policy.

            <p>
              As an employee or affiliate of 54gene, it is your responsibility
              to prevent any form of bribery and corruption. If you notice a
              colleague or a superior engaging in any of the prohibited acts
              under this policy, you may report using the Company’s grievance
              policy or whistleblowing mechanism. Whistleblower reports can also
              be made anonymously and the company ensures that reporters are not
              retaliated against and punishes any such retaliatory action.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must notify your manager OR the Compliance Officer or the
              confidential helpline as soon as possible if you believe or
              suspect that a conflict with or breach of this policy has occurred
              or may occur in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary
              action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct.
              Employees who fail to make a report may be considered complicit to
              the misconduct.
            </p>
            <p>
              54gene reserves the right to terminate our contractual
              relationship with other workers and/or third parties if they
              breach this policy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="numbered">Record-Keeping</h2>
            <p>
              We keep financial records and have appropriate internal controls
              in place which evidence the business reason for making payments to
              third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must declare and keep a written record of all hospitality or
              gifts accepted or offered, which will be subject to managerial
              review.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must ensure all expenses claims relating to hospitality, gifts
              or expenses incurred to third parties are submitted in accordance
              with our expenses policy and specifically record the reason for
              the expenditure.
            </p>
            <p>
              All accounts, invoices, memoranda and other documents and records
              relating to dealings with third parties, such as clients,
              suppliers and business contacts, should be prepared and maintained
              with strict accuracy and completeness. To avoid the facilitation
              or concealment of improper payments, no accounts may be kept
              "off-book".
            </p>

            <h2 class="numbered">How To Raise a Concern</h2>
            <p>
              You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion
              of malpractice at the earliest possible stage. If you are unsure
              whether a particular act constitutes bribery or corruption, or if
              you have any other queries or concerns, these should be raised
              with your line manager OR the Compliance Officer or through the
              confidential helpline.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company will familiarize all employees with its whistleblowing
              procedures so employees can vocalize their concerns swiftly and

            <h2 class="numbered">What to do if you are a victim of bribery or corruption</h2>
            <p>
              It is important that you tell the Compliance Officer or the
              confidential helpline as soon as possible if you are offered a
              bribe by a third party, are asked to make one, suspect that this
              may happen in the future, or believe that you are a victim of
              another form of unlawful activity.
            </p>
            <h2 class="numbered">Protection</h2>
            <p>
              Employees who refuse to accept or offer a bribe, or those who
              raise concerns or report another's wrongdoing, are sometimes
              worried about possible repercussions. We encourage openness and
              will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith
              under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental
              treatment or retaliatory action as a result of refusing to take
              part in bribery or corruption, or because of reporting in good
              faith their suspicion that an actual or potential bribery or other
              corruption offence has taken place or may take place in the
              future. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary
              action, threats or other unfavorable treatment connected with
              raising a concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such
              treatment, you should inform the Compliance Officer immediately.
              If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should
              raise it formally using the Company’s Grievance Procedure.
            </p>
