          <h2>Our Stand Against the Unauthorised Use and Infringement of Our Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout this COVID-19 period, the results of private testing laboratories 
            across Nigeria have been subject to counterfeiting and forgery by a handful 
            of dishonest individuals to provide fake results to persons who have not been 
            tested. Counterfeiting and forgery which is a criminal offence involves the 
            illegal and unauthorised use of the Company’s trade name, trademarks and 
            brand image which amounts to Intellectual Property (IP) infringement.
            <br></br>
            54gene takes such acts of IP infringement involving the counterfeiting and 
            forgery of our results and any other illegal conduct extremely seriously. 
            Such acts while being wholly unfair and illegal, threaten the integrity 
            process of the entire diagnostics sector - and certainly in this current 
            climate, it is also unsafe, as we are working hard to reduce the spread 
            of COVID-19.
            <br></br>
            In the same vein, we take seriously publications/communications 
            that abuse our IP rights or defames our brand name. While we 
            recognize the need for journalists to communicate valid, 
            verifiable and up to date information, note that our brand name 
            and IP rights are very important to us. Publications on the issues 
            surrounding fake results must not carry the 54gene name in its heading 
            or in its body in any way that may be misinterpreted or found to be 
            misleading or defamatory in any form; and any reference to 54gene must 
            be in line with current position and as advised by our communications team. 
            Note that violation of our policy on publications will incur legal action 
            including recovery for damages.
            <br></br>
            As an immediate first step in this fight against counterfeit test results, 
            we have built a validation portal to counter the circulation of fake test 
            results, and to safeguard the public, who ultimately lose out in this 
            situation. Going forward, we will be taking legal action against any 
            individuals or businesses who we find to be infringing on 54gene’s 
            intellectual property in any format, or indeed using our name for any 
            commercial gain. It is important for us to take a stand against Intellectual 
            Property infringement, as we work hard with our peers to ensure globally 
            recognised rigour when it comes to maintaining international compliance 
            standards and protecting Intellectual Property Rights.
            <br></br>
            In its two years since launch, the 54gene team has worked hard to build 
            a globally recognisable brand, underpinned by our core values; Results, 
            Purpose, Safety, Caring, Learning, and Uncompromised Leadership. Integrity 
            underpins absolutely everything we do across our company and we are unequivocal 
            about protecting the stellar work our scientists do to improve the health of 
            Nigerians. We will not stand by or be idle when it comes to fighting against 
            any corruption within our power.
